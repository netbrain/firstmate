# Safe, home-scoped (re-)arm of the firstmate watcher, with honest verification.
#
# The watcher (bin/fm-watch.sh) blocks until it has an actionable wake to
# surface, then prints one reason line and exits. While state/.afk exists the
# daemon owns triage and the watcher exits on every wake for the daemon to
# classify. Reliability depends on arming through a mechanism that SURVIVES the
# call and NOTIFIES on exit, so firstmate must run this script as the harness's
# own tracked background task (e.g. run_in_background), or - for a Claude
# primary - inside the Stop asyncRewake hook's foreground process tree
# (bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh), where the harness owns the process group and
# the hook's exit-2 rewake is the notification. Run it as its own standalone
# background task, never bundled onto the tail of another command.
# NEVER fire it and forget with a shell `&` inside another call: that backgrounded
# child is reaped when the call returns, leaving NO watcher running and a false
# "already running" off the dying process. That exact mistake silently took
# supervision down for ~30 minutes.
# On a harness with a PreToolUse-equivalent hook, bin/fm-arm-pretool-check.sh
# applies the command-position policy before the command runs; see
# docs/arm-pretool-check.md for the blessed tree and deny reason codes. It is a
# pre-execution seatbelt, not a substitute for the verification here.
#
# This script forks the watcher as a tracked child, then VERIFIES the outcome
# before it settles in. It confirms a watcher process is genuinely alive AND the
# liveness beacon (state/.last-watcher-beat) is fresh within FM_GUARD_GRACE (the
# single source of truth, shared with fm-watch.sh and fm-guard.sh), and prints
# exactly one unambiguous status line:
#   watcher: started pid=<N> (beacon fresh)              - it launched one and confirmed it
#   watcher: attached pid=<N> (beacon <age>s)            - a live+fresh successor holds the lock;
#                                                          this arm attaches and follows it
#   watcher: FAILED - no live watcher with a fresh beacon  - could not confirm one
#   watcher: FAILED - cycle ended without an actionable reason
#                                                        - a clean cycle ended with no wake and no
#                                                          verified healthy successor
# It NEVER reports started/attached/healthy off a stale beacon or a dead/reused pid: a
# stale-beacon or dead-pid holder either self-heals (the fresh child steals the
# dead lock per the singleton self-eviction/steal path and is confirmed) or this
# returns the FAILED line. On started it waits the child and propagates the wake
# reason; on attached it stays live across identity-matched successors. A cycle
# that ends with no reason line and no healthy successor is resolved against the
# watcher's identity-bound delivery record: a matching record reports that wake
# and exits 0, and only a cycle that delivered nothing is the typed nonzero
# failure. Neither is ever a clean empty completion. On FAILED it exits non-zero
# so the failure is loud. A live cycle already present means re-arm attaches - do
# not start a second watcher.
#
# Every observed watcher cycle appends one tab-separated lifecycle record to
# state/.watch-cycle-exits.log. The arm layer owns that bounded ledger; it records
# arm/watcher identities, timestamps, exit/signal classification, beacon age,
# lock identity before and after close, and successor disposition. A ledger
# write waits a bounded interval for that log's lock and then gives up rather
# than stalling the cycle, but never silently: the skip is reported on stderr
# under its own prefix, so a missing record is never mistaken for a hand-over
# that produced no successor.
# A successor disposition is not written under that race at all. The successor
# publishes its claim as its own file under state/.watch-cycle-links with one
# lock-free atomic rename before it touches the ledger, and every later ledger
# write re-applies whatever is still outstanding while it already holds the
# log's lock, retiring a claim only once the applied ledger is committed. A
# claim names its predecessor by arm pid AND recorded pid-identity, so a
# recycled pid can never collect another cycle's link. Contention can
# therefore delay a link but can never lose it, which is what keeps
# successor=none meaning "no successor" instead of "a successor whose link lost
# a race" - and the wait is never lengthened, because waiting longer cannot fix
# a race the arm is not allowed to block on. The separate
# state/.watch-triage.log remains exclusively the watcher's absorbed-wake debug
# log and is never written here.
#
# --restart: stop ONLY this FM_HOME's watcher (the pid recorded in THIS home's
# state/.watch.lock) and own a fresh cycle, or attach if a verified live peer
# wins the singleton while the duplicate child stands down. It
# resolves and signals exactly that pid, so it can never touch another home's
# watcher. NEVER `pkill -f
# bin/fm-watch.sh`: that pattern matches every firstmate home's watcher
# (secondmate homes run the same script) and would kill siblings.
#
# --stop: the same home-scoped stop without re-arming, for an owner that ends
# its own supervision cycle on purpose (the supervision host's park boundary,
# bin/fm-supervision-host.sh). The stopped watcher publishes downtime exactly
# as any watcher close does; prints "watcher: stopped pid=<N>" or
# "watcher: none running" and exits 0, or exits 1 when the watcher outlived
# the stop.
#
# A copy of this script living under a disposable no-mistakes validation
# checkout (a path containing /.no-mistakes/worktrees/) refuses every mode with
# "watcher: FAILED - refusing to arm from a disposable validation checkout" and
# exits 1 before touching any state: a watcher armed from there outlives the
# validation step, holds the real home's lock, and keeps writing that home's
# state from a checkout that is about to be deleted. Firstmate's own test suite
# runs from exactly such a checkout during validation, so the same
# FM_GATE_REFUSE_BYPASS=1 escape hatch tests/lib.sh already exports for
# bin/fm-gate-refuse-lib.sh lifts this refusal for a test's sandboxed home.
